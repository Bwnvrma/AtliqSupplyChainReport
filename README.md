# AtliqSupplyChainReport
Created a Dashboard delivering Insight from Supply Chain Dataset for the following Problem Statement.


AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend the annual contract due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

As Data Analyst Team,we decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘on-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’ and OnTime in full (OTIF) % of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.
Developed a Report with special focus on City, Product and Customer etc.
With the help of this dashboard one could easily find where the problem lies and how can it be handled.

Three things that I have learned while doing this exercise:
1. Creating dashboard according to the need of business and flexibility to use Power BI as a powerful Data Analysis Tool.
2. Understood some concepts of supply chain and how supply chain works.
3. Using KPI (Key Performance Indicator) to show top-level metrics.
